# Resume

Here can be found my resume. Data is stored in `./resume.json`. 
A script is provided in `index.html` to generate an HTML version that is more human readable. 
The HTML version can be printed as a PDF for use in applications.

This data is also used to populate my personal site at [bncarey42.github.io](http://bncarey42.github.io)
