        				<p>Implemented C/C++ algorithms on an embedded ARM processor to read input from a number

                  of research and development were presented to fellow classmates and school corporate partners

      			<ul>
              <li>
      					<p>This project was a practice in building online a JSP/Servlet App that
                  communicates with a provided MySQL database. The goal of this project
                  was to build an app for the fictional country, Finlandia’s Olympic team,
                  to determine if an athlete would be eligible to compete in the 2020
                  summer Olympics. The user inputs their Athlete ID (two letters and
                  three numbers), first and last name, and birth date. Then, the system
                  adds this athlete to the database and determines if they are eligible
                   to compete in the Olympics on the date of the opening ceremony.

              <li>
      					<p>This group project was a practice in designing and implementing a
                  database system. We were asked to design a database around the needs
                  of a business. It was elected that we would build a Database for a
                  pastry shop with a growing client base and adding delivery capabilities
                  to their offerings. I designed the table, creating data insertion
                  scripts as well as two queries to extract data from the database. The
                  project was tested and implemented in Oracle Application Express. I
                  was also responsible for authoring a simple initial project proposal,
                  outlining our use case and basic plan for implementation, as well as
                  creating the visual entity-relationship model.

      			<h4>Mancala (Class project: CSCI 2466 J2EE-JSP & Servlets)</h4>
      			<ul>
              <li>
      					<p>This was project for a course on J2EE and Servlets. Mancala is a
                  browser based game emulating a Kala style board game. Players play
                  from opposite side of a game board made up of a series of pits with
                  two large end pits on either side of the board. Players move small
                  seeds or beans across their side of the board depositing a singular
                  bean in each open pit depositing a bean in their end-pit if they
                  should round the corner to the other side of the board. Built in the
                  JSP and Servlet MVC, this project was a practice in using cookies to
                  save the board state as well as formatting the board in the JSP file
                  to display the board accurately allowing the pits, represented by an
                  array, to move beans seemingly backwards across player two’s side of
                  the board while the model code moves the beans through the array forwards.
